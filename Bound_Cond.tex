The function below is an implementation of the boundary conditions. The density of the new solution array is "fetched" from the adjacent cells in the old density array. The $\rho V$ arrays are always set to zero at the bounds since there can be no velocity at the boundaries. Here to update the thermodynamic solution array, the current pressure arrays, velocity arrays, and density arrays are used. This requires the density, velocity, pressure arrays to be updated to the old solution first.
