Below are the utilities to compute the fluxes. The functions here operate on the arrays \url{Flux1}, \url{Flux2}, and \url{Flux3}. Calling the functions here update the flux arrays to either hold the positive fluxes or the negative fluxes. The flux arrays cannot hold positive and negative fluxes at the same time.
